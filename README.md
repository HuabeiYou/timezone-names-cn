Simple key-value map from standard timezone names (in English) to Chinese and also other way around.

All english timezone names (over 500) are taken from `moment-timezone` (and therefore should work with most of the time conversion tools).
The Chinese translation is generated by `soimort/translate-shell` and edited by me. 

### Usage
```javascript
import { cn, en } from '@h6you/timezone-names-cn'

console.log(cn['America/Toronto']) // 美洲/多伦多
console.log(en['美洲/多伦多']) // America/Toronto
```

If you find a translation error, please let me know so I can fix it.
