Simple key-value map from IANA timezone names (in English) to Chinese and also the other way around.

All english timezone names (over 500) are taken from `moment-timezone` (and therefore should work with most of the time conversion tools).
The Chinese translation is generated by `soimort/translate-shell` and edited by me. If you find a translation error, please let me know so I can fix it.

The UTC/GMT offset values are not included in the map for simplicity, but an utility function `utcOffset` is provided
for calculating the current offset on the fly.

### Usage
```javascript
import { cn, en, utcOffset } from '@h6you/timezone-names-cn'

console.log(cn['America/Toronto']) // 美洲/多伦多
console.log(en['美洲/多伦多']) // America/Toronto

const offsetMinitesSH = utcOffset('Asia/Shanghai')
console.log(offsetMinitesSH) // 480

const offsetMinitesTO = utcOffset('America/Toronto')
console.log(offsetMinitesTO) // -300 during EST and -240 during EDT
```
